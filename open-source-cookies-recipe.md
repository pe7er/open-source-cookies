## Ingredients
- 165 grams of white brown sugar
- 250 grams of margarine
- 180 grams flour
- 150 grams whole wheat flour
- 2 teaspoons of baking powder
- A pinch of salt

## Preparation
- Put all the ingredients in a bowl in the order of the listed ingredients.
- Mix everything into a dough ball.
- Roll it out on a piece of baking paper into a thick log of 4 or 5 cm thick. 
- Harden the log by placing it in the fridge for 30 minutes.
- Slice the log into small (approximately 8 to 10 mm) pieces.
- Place them on the baking paper on a wire rack in a preheated oven.
- Bake at 170°C for 15 to 17 minutes or until the edges are golden brown.
- Remove the whole (hot!) rack from the oven.
- Slide the baking sheet along with the biscuits (still warm and soft) onto a flat surface like a wooden table.
- The biscuits will harden when cooled.
- After cooling, put them in a drum. That way they stay nice and crispy.
- Enjoy!
